Hi, a few weeks ago I came to Putumayo in Colombia. Now I have the idea of staying here longer, learning more from the medicine and traditional knowledge and possibly creating a place of transformation in nature. But how did this come about?

About a year and a half ago I had a small crisis of meaning in combination with a kind of enlightenment experience:

At that time I was working as a consultant for a German car company with two letters, had my first deeper experiences with meditation and states of consciousness and realized that my life doesn't have the sense it should have.

In order to change this, I decided to work hard for another nine months to put on a financial cover and to separate myself from all superfluous possessions, to spend the next two years leading a minimalist life and to use the time to finally write my thesis and to go around the world as a backpacker.

When I was out of work and homeless last summer, I began to hitchhike through Europe, visiting festivals and gatherings as well as new and old friends. When the summer was over, I came to Berlin with my dear friend Tillmann to finish my master thesis. Fascinated by the possibilities of blockchain, smart contracts and decentralized apps, I plunged myself deeper and deeper into rabbit hole... first in search of a research question.

Instead of finding them, the idea of a transformative game grew in me: The aim of the game is to bring people together, to reach a consensus about what we want to create together and to realize these things. I started working on the concept and talking to different people about it.

In mid-December I was part of an Ayuhuasca ceremony and had the inspiration to travel to the Amazon to learn about the origins of this powerful and magical medicine.

So I came to Putumayo at the beginning of February and was part of a tour through Putumayo, organized by [Pinta Yage][website-pinta-yage] and [Tita Juan Jamioy][video-taita-juan]. We got to know his homeland, visited the rainforest and indigenous tribes living there, learned to cook the medicine and had a variety of ceremonies and cleanings with Yage (Ayuhuasca), Yopo, Mambe and Kambo.

During the journey I met the spirits of the jungle, experienced the deep meaning of my life, became aware of my and universal hidden powers and was given the task of staying here to build a bridge between medicine, traditional knowledge and our western culture and technology.

Since then, the plan has been to learn more about this world and possibly create a place of transformation somewhere in this magical, powerful and originally nature. A place where the medicine can develop all its power and the cultures can meet and unite to bring healing to all people, all beings and the planet.

This new blog is the first building block of the bridge between the worlds, the first step towards transformation and entry point for all supporters.
