As described in the [previous article](/beginning/), during the journey through Putumayo, the vision of creating a place of transformation somewhere in this magical, powerful and pristine nature was born.


Laura (one of [Pinta Yage][website-pinta-yage]) told me on the last morning of this tour that she and Taita Juan had visited a beautiful plot of land and the idea is to found a healing centre and a kind of ecovillage. This could be financed by crowdfunding. That sounded like a suitable project for me.

Three days later I met Carole from Belgium in Subundoy. During her time in South America she has designed a game with the aim to identify, care for and mediate street dogs. She has also advised local initiatives on crowdfunding. We talked a lot about gamification, crowdfunding, the problems of the local people and the possibilities of the Crypto Economy.

The next morning it all came together:

**Healing centre = place of transformation = ecovillage = crowdfunding = first step towards transformative game**

Inspired by this insight I sketched the following concept. It should be understood as a proposal for the financing and organization of a healing centre or ecovillage based on the blockchain.

### The Transformative Power of Decentralization

I am convinced that decentralized systems such as the Blockchain carry an enormous transformative power. They enable us to take responsibility for ourselves, to reorganize ourselves in a decentralized manner (without central authorities) and to do so locally and, if necessary, globally.

Up to now, it has mostly been projects in the area of the blockchain itself that use these instruments. In my opinion, they are also ideal for financing housing projects, social projects, healing centres, schools and ecovillages.

The reason why they have not been used so far is that the knowledge about these possibilities and the practical handling of tokens and crypto currencies has not yet reached the masses. This article is the first attempt to give an introduction to these possibilities.

### Financing by Token Sales

A token sale, also known as [Initial Coin Offering][ico] (ICO), is an interesting variant of crowdfounding. Tokens are offered for sale within a certain period of time for a certain price.

Like a classic currency (EUR, USD,...) a token usually has a three-digit letter code and can be used as a means of payment.

Ordinary currencies can only be issued by banks and central banks. Thanks to Blockchanins and Smart Contracts, everyone is now able to create their own tokens. All you have to do is upload a special Smart Contract (the Token Contract) on a suitable blockchain. Afterwards you can create your own tokens and sell them in a crowdsale:

In our case, it could look like this:

<div style="font-size:15px; border: 1px solid #e8e8e8; border-radius: 3px; background-color: #eef; padding: 10px;margin-bottom: 15px;">
TTransformation Tokens (short TFO) are offered at a price of 10 EUR/TFO.
</div>

There are a number of projects financed by token sales. Some of these projects are listed on [coinmarketcap][coinmarketcap] and there are numerous marketplaces where such tokens can be traded against EUR or USD.

Depending on the design of the project, the tokens can offer their owners very different benefits.

### Tokens can be exchanged for services

Once we have received sufficient start-up funding and the basic infrastructure has been set up on site, the project could offer a range of services, such as

- Ceremonies, Seminars and Workshops
- Provision of sleeping places
- food and drink
- individual healing offers

Supporters of the project can then exchange their tokens for these services.

For example, it could look like this:

<div style="font-size:15px; border: 1px solid #e8e8e8; border-radius: 3px; background-color: #eef; padding: 10px;margin-bottom: 15px;">
The whole stay including ceremonies, accommodation and meals for one day can be paid with 10 TFO.
</div>

To transfer his tokens, our guests have a wallet (digital wallet) on their notebook or smartphone. From there they send their tokens to the address of the project.

### Tokens can be given to helpers as a reward

A project that has its own currency also has a powerful tool that is normally only available to banks and central banks. It can create new tokens "Out of nothing" at any time.

Tokens can be created not only when an investor makes money available (at token sale), but also when a helper gives his time. This makes sense because a successful project needs both time and money. In this way, the project not only receives financing but also motivated helpers who tackle the task.

*Example:*

<div style="font-size:15px; border: 1px solid #e8e8e8; border-radius: 3px; background-color: #eef; padding: 10px;margin-bottom: 15px;">
Every volunteer who supports the project on a full-time basis receives 10 TFO per day.
</div>

This is a particular advantage for projects in which people of different economic backgrounds work together.

While the far-away living rich European (who has also no time to help because he works at least 8 hours a day) provides his money, the Colombian can contribute his life time on the spot. In the end, both are equally involved in the project.


### Various possibilities for democratic, decentralized control

As is usual for associations and cooperatives, meetings are very useful for setting goals and controlling activities. Tokens enhance the possibilities of democratic and decentralized control, as decisions can also be made online at any time. Thereby each token can represent a voice.

Maybe you've already wondered how we can prevent token inflation when it's so easy to "print" new tokens?

An investor who has bought tokens in the context of crowdfounding may be interested in ensuring that the value of his tokens does not decline. This means that the total amount of tokens is in a reasonable relation to the efficiency of the whole project or in other words: It is only allowed to create new tokens if it serves the project, i. e. if a countervalue is created as a result of it.

In order to ensure this and at the same time enable all supporters to contribute to the development of the project, one could vote on proposals.

A proposal could look something like this:

<div style="font-size:15px; border: 1px solid #e8e8e8; border-radius: 3px; background-color: #eef; padding: 10px;margin-bottom: 15px;">
<b>Title:</b> Construction of wooden huts
<br><br>
<b>Effort:</b> 600 TFO
<br><br>
<b>Description:</b> 3 wooden huts will be built and for that purpose 600 new tokens will be generated. As a result, a additional 6 people can be accommodated. Thanks to the new huts, the project will be able to generate additional income in the future. Additional helpers can also move here.
</div>

So tokens are only ever created for a specific purpose and only if the majority has voted in favour.

For example, a vote could take 7 days. Supporters could vote on a website or with an app. If the proposal is accepted, 600 new tokens will be created. These will be paid out as soon as the three huts have been built.

This means that all supporters, whether they have invested money or time and wherever they are, can help shape the direction of the project.

### Summary

In this article I have outlined the most basic possibilities that arise from the world of Blockchains, Smart Contracts and Crypto Economy for the organization of projects:

1. Projects can be financed by selling tokens.
2. Tokens can be exchanged for benefits at a later date
3. Volunteers can be rewarded, involved and motivated by tokens
3. Tokens enable democratic control of projects

I am looking forward to your questions and feedback. It gives me the opportunity to improve this article further and show me what I should cover in further articles.

Especially I hope to start a discussion or get a stone rolling, which might lead to some successful projects.
